Just as traditional flipbooks let users observe the evolution of a scene, by leafing through it's pages at their own pace ...

... new *code* flipbooks, allow users to observe the evolution of a code pipeline alongside the resulting output.


---

# Flipbooks...

--

## present code and output


## side-by-side


## and step-by-step

--

## like a *stop-motion movie* 
--
based on someone actually building a code pipeline
--
checking intermediate output states as they go


---

Talk Overview:

1. Flipbooks origin story.
2. Demo and modalities.
3. Why Flipbooks?

# 2018: proto flipbooks

```{r, out.width="33%", fig.show="hold"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("figures/garrick_proto_flipbook.png",
                          "figures/gina_proto_flipbook.png",
                          "figures/emi_proto_flipbook.png"))
```

--

Hand-crafted, 
Artisanal


???

In 2018, the proto flipbook emerged on the Xaringan platform.  But each frame of the flipbook was individually crafted, which was kind of painstaking.

# Do you want to build "flipbooks" together?


???

I wanted to collaborate with these brilliant like-minded people.  And they were game...  (This is exactly when flipbooks got their name too!)


---
background-image: url(figures/moth_circling.jpg)
background-size: cover

???

We were kind of all circling around the idea - "flipbooks" had huge potential.  They could deliver a lot of insight about code behavior to their consumers. 



---
background-image: url(figures/volt_meter_thomas_kelley_unsplash.jpg)

???

But to realize the full potential, creators needed to be unburdened from copy and paste. Flipbooks were a pain to build manually.



---

# Move to automate


## *Automatically* parsing a block of input code 

--

## *Automatically* reconstructing code into partial builds

--

## *Automatically* delivered on a presentation platform (here Xaringan)


???

Able to do this in large part because of the flexibility of knitr and rmarkdown documents!!!


---

# 2019

# Exploration, refinement, testing, and refactoring

???

Exploring what could be done in this space, and think about what would be useful for consumers and creators




---


# 2020

# You can build a flipbook five minutes...

--
# ...with {flipbookr}

--
## devtools::install_github("EvaMaeRey/flipbookr")

--

# and {xaringan} (on CRAN)


???

Today, you can build a flipbook in 5 minutes with flipbookr.  

During this talk I'm going to show you how you can build a flipbook in five minutes using the flipbookr package and the Rmarkdown slide show tool, Xaringan.

I'll show you three modalities for revealing your code incrementally.

And three modalities for diplaying this evolution.

Then, I'll make you aware of some of the diversity of use cases where flipbooking may be used.

In the second part of the talk, I'll try to articulate just why I think this tool is valuable as a new communication device, and valuable to add to your tool box.

For the demo, I'm going to use a dialect of ggplot, Slowggplot, which is just ggplot

???

For the demo, I'm going to use a dialect of ggplot, Slowggplot, which is just ggplot - but making sure to work as incrementally as possible, fully appreciating each plotting decision we make.

# Embraces: 

--
# *incrementalism*

--
# *feedback*


???

Flipbooking works really naturally with ggplot, when it is approached in this way.

When you flipbook, this will make the code-output connection link very clear.

class: middle

# .large[one ggplot <br> statement]
--

# .large[per decision]



---



# What's a SLOWggplot look like?

--

1. Pull out aes() from the ggplot() function *ggplot(data = my_data) + aes(x = var1)*

--

2. One ggplot statement per decision, if possible *aes(x = var1) + aes(y = var2) rather than aes(x = var1, y = var2)*

--

3. Use `::`.  Use base R functions and tidyverse functions directly. For other packages, use the `package::function()` style to call them, so their source is clear.

--

4. write out arguments (no shortcuts) *aes(x = gdppercap) not aes(gdppercap)*

--

5. order ggplot commands so that reactivity is obvious

  - In practice this means writing positional aes() statements before geoms .  These are required aesthetics and they deliver feedback without the geom plotted.  
  - Other aesthetic decisions should follow geoms, like color, size, linetype etc. These are optional and stating them before declaring the geom means that feedback isn't delivered.
  - aes(label = ?) comes before geom_text() and geom_label() because it is required


--

6. using fewer functions; example - using labs() to add a title instead of ggtitle()

---




# from some ggplot documentation

> `+` is the key to constructing sophisticated ggplot2 graphics. It allows you to start simple, then get more and more complex, **checking your work at each step.**





---

`r flipbookr::chunk_reveal("fast_ggplot", display_type = "code")`


```{r fast_ggplot, include = F}
ggplot(data = cars, 
       mapping = aes(x = speed, 
                     y = dist, 
                     col = dist)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Speed (mph)",
       y = "Distance (feet)",
       title = "Speed v. Stopping ...")
```





---

`r flipbookr::chunk_reveal("slow", display_type = "code")`


```{r slow, include = F}
cars %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = speed) +
  aes(y = dist) +
  geom_point() +
  aes(color = dist) +
  labs(x = "Speed (mph)") +
  labs(y = "Distance (feet)") +
  labs(title = "Speed v. Stopping ...")
```



---

`r flipbookr::chunk_reveal("my_cars_again")`

```{r my_cars_again, echo = F, eval = F}
cars %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = speed) +
  aes(y = dist) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  aes(color = speed)
```

???

And this is the output we are going after.
We're going to work with a template, write this slowggplot code, and turn it into a flipbook built in Xaringan.

???

We've tried to make creating flipbooks easy for you.  But it is still a bit of extra effort.  So I want to go back to the topic of why it is a good communication tool.

# when newcomers see a long pipeline of code ...

???

They may feel like this is the message

breaks down the steps with accompanying output, is something that newcomers have a better chance at following.

Even for seasoned practicioner might not be familiar with all the pieces of a pipeline.  

A seasoned user will probably manage to infer what an unfamiliar function or two are doing in a pipeline, but this requires a lot of mental gymnastics and concentration. 

Flipbooks allow people to narrow in on unfamiliar steps, looking what immediately preceeds and immediately follows.  To alleviate this burden.

???

Lateral comparison is hard; superimposed temporal comparison is easy; Consider the \"spot the differences\" games. Imagine if these images were super imposed.  Flickering back and forth between the two of them, superimposed and aligned, and with changes made incrementally (one-by-one), the challenge would be taken out of the game.

"Visual search" games are fun because they are challenging.

Blink Comparator allowed researcher to toggle between two superimposed and aligned images, to allow you to and noticing what moved between different time periods -- the photos were of the night sky through a telescope

It's easy to notice motion.  Detecting differences via "motion detection" is the experience flipbooks give us.
