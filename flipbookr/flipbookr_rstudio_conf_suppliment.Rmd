???

If you want to create an object in your flipbooks, it is most "natural" to use [right assignment](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/assignOps.html).

Working sequentially with a pipeline of code, you get feedback all along the way until you get to the point of assigning all of what you have done to a new object with reverse assignment.  With regular assignment in R, you don't get any feedback, so flipbooking prefers this step at the end of a pipeline, so we can enjoy all the nice feedback. So the parameter left_assign is by default set to FALSE.

# `left_assign = TRUE`



???

But, setting the left_assign parameter to T and using regular assignment, you can still create a meaningful flipbook that gives you feedback.   When left_assign = T, the first object that is created prints at the end of the derivative code chunks. 


---

`r chunk_reveal("left_assign", break_type = "auto", display_type = "both", left_assign = T)`


```{r left_assign, echo = F, eval = F}
my_plot <- cars %>%  
  filter(speed > 
           4) %>%  
  ggplot() +      
  aes(x = speed) +
  aes(y = dist) +
  geom_point()
```

# Use beyond the tidyverse


???

It is no surprise that Flipbooks are born in the context of the popularity of the tidyverse tools --- tools that are designed be be used in sequential pipelines and that give a satisfying amount of feedback along the way!

But base R techniques and other popular tools can certainly also be employed.

# "chaining" by overwriting objects

---

`r chunk_reveal("left_assign2", break_type = "auto", display_type = "both", left_assign = T)`


```{r left_assign2, echo = F, eval = F}
cars_mod <- cars
cars_mod$half_dist <- cars$dist/2
names(cars_mod)[2] <- "distance"
cars_mod <- cars_mod[
  cars_mod$distance > 10,
  ]
cars_mod <- cars_mod["distance"]
```

# use brackets and logical indexing

## with a .[] and .[[]] syntax with the migrittr pipe - %>%


???

Flipbooking can also be applied to logical indexing workflows if the steps are broken up using the %>% followed by .[] and .[[]].  Thus flipbooking can also be used with base R logical indexing and with the popular `data.table` package. 


---

`r chunk_reveal("dot_notation")`

```{r dot_notation, include = F}
cars %>% 
  .[cars$speed > 
      median(cars$speed),] %>% 
  .["speed"] %>% 
  .[,1] ->
top_speeds
```

---

# Base R plotting

---

`r chunk_reveal("base_r_plotting")`

```{r base_r_plotting, echo = F, eval = F}
plot(cars, 
     xlab = "Speed (mph)", 
     las = 1)
lines(lowess(cars$speed, 
             cars$dist, 
             f = 2/3, 
             iter = 3), 
      col = "red")
title(main = "the `cars` data")
```


???
 
It has been a while since I've done much plotting with base R, but I think it is important to have an example or two.
