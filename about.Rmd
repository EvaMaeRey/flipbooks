*Flipbooks* present code step-by-step and side-by-side with its output. The incremental code/result reveal may help you digest longer manipulation and analysis pipelines as well as plot builds.  Long pipelines of code can produce attractive outputs.  But they can feel like long streches of *highway with no exit or entry ramps*.   Interacting with such code that has been made into a flipbook is different.  The user can isolate and gain insight about short streches along the pipeline that are useful for her or his particular project -- all the while engaged by the creativity brought by the project creator in pursuit of their own goal.  Flipbooks enable us to isolate how individual functions work in context.   

### Example

Click once in the box the below to initiate the session; then use the right and left arrow to "flip" through the book to see how to make an animated "racing" bar chart of the population size of the most populous countries over time.   


```{r}
knitr::include_url("https://evamaerey.github.io/flipbooks/racing_bars/racing_barcharts.html#1")
```


## Do It Yourself

Would you like to make a flipbook? We try to make that easy for you with {flipbookr}. To get started have a look at [A minimal Flipbook](https://evamaerey.github.io/flipbooks/flipbookr/skeleton#1){target="_blank"}, the template for which will be available once you install the [flipbooks package](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/flipbookr){target="_blank"} as follows:

```r
devtools::install_github("EvaMaeRey/flipbookr")
```

You will also likely use `xaringan`, an rmarkdown presentation builder:

```r
install.packages("xaringan")
```

#### Steps to building your first flipbook using RStudio

1. install.packages("xaringan") 
2. devtools::install_github("EvaMaeRey/flipbookr") 
3. restart RStudio
4. File -> New File -> RMarkdown -> From Template -> A Minimal Flipbook
5. Use template or your own pipelines
6. "Knit"
7. Explore your flipbook!


Using the steps above, the template will create the following book (you can explore the different modalities here):

```{r}
knitr::include_url("https://evamaerey.github.io/flipbooks/flipbookr/skeleton")
```

#### But we've all got issues

Here are a few known issues to watch for:

1. You will need an internet connection to build Xaringan output, unless you use this set up:
    - within a project execute xaringan::xaringan::summon_remark() in your console 
    - then in the YAML right after your css declaration, add, chakra: libs/remark-latest.min.js
2. *Comments* in flipbooked pipelines should *not* contain parentheses
3. Quoted text may not span lines (must be on a single line)
4. Xaringan produces an html file and associated files.  This means:
    - The output is not one, self-contained file
    - Output to be displayed in the flipbook must be supported in Xaringan and html


## Flipbooks built in-house

Here at the University of Denver, we've built a few flipbooks.  Here are some of them.

If you need a theoretical exploration of the grammar of graphics and its use with ggplot2, see [The ggplot2 grammar guide](https://evamaerey.github.io/ggplot2_grammar_guide/ggplot2_grammar_guide){target="_blank"}.

```{r, out.width="45%"}

[The geom pile on](https://evamaerey.github.io/ggplot2_grammar_guide/geoms.html){target="_blank"} is a suppliment to the ggplot grammar guide and shows you a lot of "geoms" that you can use to communicate about your data.  Piling up the geoms allows you to see howing plot types relate to one another. 


```{r, out.width="45%"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("figures/one_continuous.png", "figures/two_continuous.png"))

[the data cleaning flipbook](https://evamaerey.github.io/flipbooks/data_cleaning/data_cleaning){target="_blank"} gives you some life-changing, magical, and real-life examples of reading data into R and cleaning it (aka "tidying up").  Demonstrates uses of {janitor}, {countrycode}, and {lubridate} as well as regex with {stringr}.

## Implementation

If you are interested in contributing to {flipbookr}, you might consider getting some of the intuition of the internal functions by browsing through the resource below, or link to it  [here](https://evamaerey.github.io/little_flipbooks_library/flipbookr/flipbookr_building_blocks#1){target="_blank"}:

```{r}
knitr::include_url("https://evamaerey.github.io/flipbooks/flipbookr/flipbookr_building_blocks#1")
```


## Origins

In mid 2018 Garrick Aden-Buie, a data scientist at the Moffitt Cancer Center, created and debuted a side-by-side format for code and figure output in the slide-show tool, Xaringan, an RMarkdown tool.  He demonstrated in incremental steps how someone might build up a plot using the popular R visualization package ggplot2.  In August 2018, I emulated this work, but using a code style I developed which I called "slowggplot2", which is entirely sequential and more incremental than typical workflows. This style uses one ggplot function for every plotting decision that is made (when possible); this format is ideal for automatically parsing and reconstructing partial builds of the plots; reconstructions clearly connect the coding decision and associated behavior.  In September, Emi Tanaka, a Lecturer in Statistics at the University of Sydney, implemented a similar sequential workflow demonstration, which she partially automated.  

I approached Garrick and Emi in October about working together on "flipbooks".  We soon had a fully automated framework to parse ggplot2 code, and present the code reconstruction along with associated output!  

The procedure to automatically parse and reconstruct code was tested and refined on small projects.  Then, I created a "flipbook" of a sizable collection of my portfolio of data visualizations, originally created for the initiative #MakeoverMonday.  I publicized the work in February, 2019; *the ggplot flipbook* was met an enthusiastic reception.  

Since then, I've taken the development lead in making a number of changes to the foundational code to improve the tool and to extend use cases. Many of these improvements are discussed in the template. 

- Adding more "connection" operators as break points for code (`%>%`, `->`, `%+%`) to enable presentation beyond data visualization (initially we only used the `+`)
- Allowing code wrapping (breaks occur not necessarily at the end of lines) 
- Determining partial code completeness based on paretheses balancing 
- Using code parser rather than regular expressions to identify role of text segments 
- Allowing the user to define the reveal points (with the special `#BREAK` comment)
- Allowing the user to define non-sequential reveal (with `#BREAK2`, `#BREAK3` etc)
- Allowing code to be multiply revealed (multiple realizations of same code)
- Allowing for output only or code only display (as opposed to just side by side)
- Tracking objects created with left assignment
- Separating the parsing, code reconstruction, and presentation platform delivery steps, to make code more flexible, and robust.
