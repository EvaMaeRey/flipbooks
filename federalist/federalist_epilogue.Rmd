"I believe I've got material for writing one of the world's most boring data story.  One theme is *stop words* --- I'll explain them --- but arguably they are the boringest of words.  And we'll be talking about the stop words in the federalist paper -- some old (boring?) documents!  I'm doing an analytic post mortem here.  The non-boring thing to do is to fix the mistakes found in post mortems and move on.  I have done this, [updating the original federalist papers work]().  But also, I dig into the question: how consequential is correcting the mistake?  In this case, the correction is pretty inconsequential, which makes this data story so very dull!  The only thing that is kind of interesting is using a flipbooking (temporal offset of data and visuals) to compare outcomes of these decisions.  I feel like this kind of comparison --- showing just how very similar two things are --- is new uncharted territory for flipbooks.  You can flicker between outcomes for different decisions, and be stunned by lack of change too!  But I'll grant that if you are looking for some data story bedtime reading, this might be just the trick to put you to sleep.  Buckle up for a boring read.  " -> intro

# Chapter 1: The mistake

---





```{r, include = F}
"So in my work federalist papers network vis work, I wanted to only use stop words from the papers.  Stop words are low content words, that usually occur pretty frequently in texts. They serve grammatical purposes. But are often are removed in text analysis seeking to do topic modeling. Stop words just look like noise in this context.  But the classic question for the federalist papers is not about the paper's themes, it is about who wrote the *disputed texts*.  There are 15 texts that both Hamilton and Madison claimed to have written.  For this, those idiosyncratic turns of phrase and stop word frequency can be rather telling! You'd definitely not want to remove stop words.  In fact, you might only want to keep stop words.  This was my intent when I used a right join.  But this is a mistake.   While stop words are frequently occuring and common examples will definitely be present in every text (my favorite examples *the*, *and*, *of* certainly always are), sometimes stop words *don't* occur in texts.  So really an inner join is better to look only at the stop words that occur in the texts.  Don't assume that text will have all stop words. David Robinson pointed this out. Thanks David!  Now, we'll see the preparation of the federalist data, and then compare the inner join vs anti join of federalist paper words on stop words, demonstrating that indeed there are stop words beyond those used in the fed papers." -> chapter1

## first getting and prepping the federalist data

```{r start, include = T}
library(tidyverse) # data manipulation and viz functions
library(corpus) # has the federalist papers corpus
corpus::federalist %>% 
  mutate(author = replace_na(author, 
                             "Disputed")) %>% 
  mutate(name = paste(author, 
                      str_remove(name, "eralist"), 
                      sep = "-")) -> 
federalist

federalist %>% 
  glimpse()
```


---

## There are 15 disputed texts

```{r}
federalist %>% 
  group_by(author) %>% 
  tally() ->
the_tally

the_tally 
```

---

`r chunk_reveal("doc_term_stop", break_type = "rotate", title = "### The *inner* join shows us stop words that appear in the federalist papers while, the *anti* join shows us stop words **not** in the federalist papers. Lots with apostrophes for example.")`

```{r doc_term_stop, include = F}
federalist %>%
  select(name, text, title) %>% 
  tidytext::unnest_tokens(output = word, 
                          input = text) ->
federalist_words

tidytext::stop_words %>% 
  inner_join(federalist_words) %>% #ROTATE
  anti_join(federalist_words) %>% #ROTATE
  distinct(word)
```

---

### Now this is the *correct* preparation, which includes only the stop words in the federalist papers.

```{r doc_term_prep1, include = T}
federalist %>%
  select(name, text, title) %>% 
  tidytext::unnest_tokens(output = word, input = text) %>% 
  # stop word are good for stylometry - keep them only
  inner_join(tidytext::stop_words) %>% #<<
  group_by(name, word) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  arrange(-n) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% # document term frequency 
  widyr::pairwise_cor(item = name,
                      feature = word, 
                      value = n, 
                      sort = TRUE) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(item1)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(item2)) ->
document_correlation_inner #<<
```

---

### And this is the *incorrect* preparation, which includes preserves all the stop words even if they are not in the federalist papers.  

```{r doc_term_prep2, include = T}
federalist %>%
  select(name, text, title) %>% 
  tidytext::unnest_tokens(output = word, input = text) %>% 
  # stop word are good for stylometry - keep them only
  right_join(tidytext::stop_words) %>% #<<
  group_by(name, word) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  arrange(-n) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% # document term frequency 
  widyr::pairwise_cor(item = name,
                      feature = word, 
                      value = n, 
                      sort = TRUE) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(item1)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(item2)) ->
document_correlation_right #<<
```

---

`r chunk_reveal("compare_table", break_type = "rotate", title = "### Let's look at the resulting differences in correlation for word counts for the documents. Correlations are about the same for the inner v. right join -- the difference is in the third decimal place, inspecting the most correlated and least correlated docs" )`

```{r compare_table, include = F}
document_correlation_inner #ROTATE
document_correlation_right #ROTATE
```


---

`r chunk_reveal("compare_table_tail", break_type = "rotate", title = "### Looking at the least correlated cases")`

```{r compare_table_tail, include = F}
document_correlation_inner %>% tail() #ROTATE
document_correlation_right %>% tail() #ROTATE
```

```{r heat_map_inner, include = F}

  theme(axis.text.x = 
          element_text(angle = 90)) +

`r chunk_reveal("heat_map_rignt", break_type = 1, title = "### Visually inspecting these two heat maps, you're hard pressed to see a difference.")`

  theme(axis.text.x = 
          element_text(angle = 90)) +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 4)) +
  aes(y = item2) +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1) +
  geom_tile() +

                       limits = c(.75,1)) +

#  Epilogue to the Epilogue? 

### I think that I'd like to do a better job trying to communicate what is happening when those between document correlations are being calculated.  This feels a bit glossed over, but it'd be nice to try to show an example of the correlation at least for one document.  This might also provide total clarity as to why these stray stop words don't seem to influence the outcome much at all.
