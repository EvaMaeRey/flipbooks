# Preface

Like so many textbooks, this one is born out of a teaching observation:   *bite-sized pieces  are good for digestion*.  Moving incrementally through material is more comprehensible and less overwhelming.  The new code display tools, [flipbooks](https://evamaerey.github.io/flipbooks/about){target="_blank"}, deliver bite-sized pieces because they show code step-by-step and side-by-side with output. 

At the moment "textbook" is a bit aspirational. The source material for the book project was a motley crew of flipbooks that I developed *ad-hoc* for teaching or for fun. Organizing these one-off projects to logically hang together is a work in progress.  Moreover, the material doesn't have a lot of context or discussion --- *flipbooks* were originally only focused on communicating *how to get things done*. So this textbook will benefit from more context and discussion alongside the coding pipelines now dominating book; this will likely happen as I teach the material. Until then, students and educators might think of the project as more of a reference book --- hopefully still useful. 

Please feel free to be in touch with suggestions on *The R Flipbook Textbook's* organization or content.

# Acknowledgements:

There would be no flipbooks without great APIs and communication tools.  I'm particularly grateful to Yihui Xie for the Rmarkdown tools, and particularly for Xaringan upon which flipbooks are built. 

I'm also grateful to Hadley Wickham and his team for ggplot - the design of which was *the* inspiration for the flipbooks project.  And to Hadley Wickham, Stefan Milton Bache, and others who have had made tools for and have provided great educational materials on sequential and incremental workflows in data manipulation and analysis. 

There would also be no flipbooks without the amazing hackers [Emi Tanaka](https://emitanaka.rbind.io/post/knitr-knitr-code/){target="_blank"} and [Garrick Aden-Buie](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/blog/decouple-code-and-output-in-xaringan-slides/){target="_blank"}, whose insights and efforts were critical in getting the "flipbooks" project off the ground.
