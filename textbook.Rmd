Like so many textbooks, this one is born out of teaching experience. I have been lucky enough to teach several obligatory methodology courses at the University of Denver.  While it is lovely to teach electives, where students select into courses, I think we grow the most as teachers when students are diverse and perhaps don't come in with a "warm" attitude toward the subject matter. 

a desire to put tools into the hands of my students.  As such, there has been 

This text book is under construction.  Much of the material doesn't have a lot of context, because these flipbooks were originally only focused on communicating how to get things done in R.  I hope to be enhancing the flipbooks to provide more context alongside the coding pipeline material that presently dominates.
